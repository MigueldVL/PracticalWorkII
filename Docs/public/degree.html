       <i> I currently find myself studying in the University Francisco de Vitoria. My future job yet remains unclear to me which is the reason why I study both mathematics and computer science. 
       <br> I am very lucky to have found this course that makes me enjoy while studying, since it's of high interest to me, but, how did I get to this point? 
       <br> I have always been constant with my studies, from the age of 3 until I was 15 I attended a school in the center of Madrid called Willoughby International Collage, where I discovered how interested I actually was on mathematics and everything behind it.
       <br> That same year I started going to a college called SEK ciudalcampo to study IB, which stands for International Baccalaureate. Place in which I kept developing passion for maths and losing interest for almost every other subject, specially those unrelated to maths, ever since then, I knew this was where I was meant to be.</i> <br><br><br><br>
