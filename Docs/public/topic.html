    In Spain, there are many days along the year which are considered national vacations and most spaniards get to enjoy that time among their family members, friends, or anyone close enough to share these important dates with. Among my friends there is a lot of disagreement regarding which of these vacations is of uppermost importance however.<br><br>
    I tend to argue that certain events such as christmas or easter are the most important dates because not only are they celebrated in Spain, but also everywhere else. Furthermore, these festivities were set based on important events which, to me, gives them a huge cultural value.<br><br>
    In order to finish this argument, I wanna ask for your opinion and, whichever festivity is stated the most, will be concluded to be the most important one, so please dont forget to include your favourite vacation!<br><br><br>
