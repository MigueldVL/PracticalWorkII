To start off, I used Visual Studio Code in order to create all the documents as assigned by Moisés in the instructions, following the stems of the tree and doing it in order. Then, I started operating in each one of them.
Afterwards, I created the style.css to set up the style of my website closer to the one given in the example, these styles were undergoing constant changes due to indecisions all the time and lots of doubts.
Moreover, I created a common structure, with all the socials down beneath, the hyperlinks to the other sections despite them yet being blank, and the UFV logo, putting all the pictures in the images carpet.
Lastly, I started going one by one through the sections, making all the changes needed following the instructions for my website to look at least similarly to the one shown by Moisés.

Problems:
I was not able to make my forms work, when you press submit, it doesnt work at all, and I was able to find on copilot how to solve it, but since its a project which has to be done by me and only me, I did not make the changes, so it doesnt work at all.
It takes me forever because I am very lost regarding these topics and I had to be constantly going back to the notes to check how things were done because I keep doing things wrongly.
The final result is rather disastrous, I did as much as I could to imitate the example website but I really don't know how its done so it ended being a bad result (sorry).

Conclusion:
I really need that tutoria. I did not even submit this, I am very very slow understanding git and html and I keep getting lost, I felt like this activity was a real challenge which overpassed me. I will request tutoria the 7th of January to try fix my mess if thats good for you, I saw there is a time available at 22:30. Sorry again <3
